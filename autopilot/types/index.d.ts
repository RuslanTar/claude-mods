/**
 * Where an autopilot run stands:
 * - running: working toward the goal, nudged on after every turn
 * - wrapping: past the context threshold, writing a handoff before a restart
 * - restarting: the restart tool was called; /clear is queued behind the turn
 * - resuming: /resume-handoff-doc was issued; its turn ending means resumed
 * - waiting: the 5-hour token window is nearly used up; parked until it resets
 * - final: time, restarts, the weekly limit or the goal: a last handoff, no restart
 * - paused: stalled twice in a row; waits for the person
 * - awaiting: the session declared it waits for something (wait_for); not nudged until a new turn starts
